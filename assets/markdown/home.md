## About Seed Raids
Seed raiding is for the people who love to herb and make some decent gold. We have organizers who actively create and run raids, to make the process run smooth and quickly. Currently we are closing in on 5.000 members. You don't have to worry about being mentioned a million times a day, we got you covered on that. We divided the channels based on faction and region, you can grab one of those roles in our get-roles channel. Interested in checking it out? https://discord.gg/wT8ZdSj
